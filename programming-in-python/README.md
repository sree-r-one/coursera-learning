In this lab you will be presented with a menu ordering system which will allow users to input three choices for a select menu. You are tasked with completing the menu system so that it returns and calculates the final bill for the user.

Objectives
Create new functions to solve specific problems.

Gain experience of using for loops to iterate over different data collections.

Create and use data structures to store, retrieve and loop over data.

Instructions
Step 1: Open the script ordering_system.py present inside the project folder.

Step 2: Run the script and, when requested, enter in the three products of your choice based on the menu - 1 = espresso, 2 = coffee etc.

Step 3: To run the script, open the terminal and execute the command below

Step 4: Extend the script to have a new function called calculate_subtotal. It should accept one argument which is the order list and return the sum of the prices of the items in the order list.

Step 5: Implement calculate_tax() which calculates the tax of the subtotal. The tax percentage is 15% of overall bill.

Step 6: Implement summarize_order() which returns a list of the names of the items that the customer ordered and the total amount (including tax) that they have to pay. The orders should show the name and price.
